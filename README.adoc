= ToDo Task Model

This is a Java/JPA model for the ToDo.txt Task format.
You MUST have JPA 2.1 available to compile this (should be no
problem as it's included in Java EE 7+).

== What works:

. The Task, Context, Status classes
. parsing simple tasks
. converting simple tasks to strings

== What should be added:

. Add http://metawidget.org/[MetaWidget] tags to entity classes.

== What's not right yet:

. It is known that Eclipse flags a _false_ error due to the lack of
persistence.xml; this file MUST NOT be here (nor in the output Jar file)
as different implementations such as ../TodoService 
must be allowed to provide it instead.
. Must remove Project/Context when parsing input, else you get
  (A) Call Mom @Home @Home @Home...
