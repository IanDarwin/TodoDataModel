= ToDo Task Model

This is a Java/JPA model for the ToDo.txt Task format.

This version uses jakarta.persistence, not the legacy javax.persistence.
If you still need javax, use release 1.2.3 or git checkout the tag 'javax'.

== What works:

. The Task, Context, Status classes
. parsing simple tasks
. converting simple tasks to strings

== What should be added:

TBA

== What's not right yet:

. Eclipse flags a _false_ error due to the lack of
persistence.xml; this file MUST NOT be in src/main/resources
(nor in the output Jar file)
as the client using this library must provide its own version.

. Must remove Project/Context when parsing input, else you get
  (A) Call Mom @Home @Home @Home...
