ToDo Task Model
===========

This is a Java/JPA model for the ToDo.txt Task format.
You MUST have JPA 2.1 available to compile this (should be no
problem as it's included in Java EE 7+).

What works:
- parsing simple tasks
- converting simple tasks to strings

What's not right yet:
- Must remove Project/Context when parsing input, else you get
  (A) Call Mom @Home @Home @Home...
